# AI-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition
I designed and implemented an AI-based face recognition attendance system for my college. Using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning, the system captures and identifies student faces in real time, automatically marking attendance in a database. This improved accuracy, reduced manual errors, and enhanced classroom efficiency.
